# E-COMMERCE
My First Complete eCommerce Website Build! 🛒💻
After months of learning, coding, debugging (and lots of coffee ☕), I’m beyond excited to share the launch of Elte Shop – a fully functional, responsive eCommerce platform built from scratch!
🔍 Key Features:
 ✅ Product filtering and sorting
 ✅ Smooth 3D animations for engaging UX
 ✅ Secure login/signup with authentication
 ✅ Payment integration (Card & QR support)
 ✅ Summer discount offers with real-time updates
 ✅ Mobile-friendly & fully responsive design
This project challenged everything I’ve learned so far—front-end, back-end, security, and even UI/UX design. From planning the architecture to deploying the final version, I handled it all as a student determined to break into real-world tech
